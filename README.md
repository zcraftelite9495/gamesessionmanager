This is a program I created in my free time to help interface with my Google Sheet for tracking all my game playtime across various platforms. Itâ€™s a personal project that I wanted to share with others on GitHub.

**Important Note:** This script is designed to work specifically with my custom Google Sheet. In order for it to function properly, you will need to use the exact same sheet. You can view and make a copy of my Google Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cYQ8B-lnzHLaO32mFZJTweRy8vqjr0Wm2kmcHEcFP8A/edit?gid=329820141#gid=329820141).

## Features

- Easily log and track playtime for different video games.
- Choice of using a terminal interface or a simple web interface.
- Automatically formats Google Sheets for better organization and readability.
- Supports multiple gaming platforms and allows for custom date entries.

## Feature Roadmap

- Impliment a way to type a game name and then hit a start session and end session button, eliminating the need to manually enter times, and allowing users to let it track sessions more easily
